Further, you have to find out what type of log is it.

Additional information:

The python code should go through each line of the attached log file, and should be able to generate a report consisting of total of sucess and error codes i.e 200 ,400 or 404 and must specifically give count of each code

Eg:  status code 200->count 30
       status code 404->count 45
 and so on for all status codes

Note:Status codes cannot be hardcoded
         eg:if status code==''200"
